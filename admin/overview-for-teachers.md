# ++CS2103DE Overview (Teacher's POV)++

**The goal of the course is to prepare students for SE internships** (note: most students do their first internship at the end of their second year, before taking any other SE courses). That includes teaching students **basic SE concepts** as well as giving them enough **practice in tools, techniques, and practices used in the industry**. This is a CS foundation course, which also can be considered as the entry point to the SE focus area, as most other SE courses have this course in the prerequisite chain.

<box type="info" seamless>

**CS2103T vs CS2103:** CS2103T students take CS2101 (Effective Communication for Computing Professionals) at the same time so that they can learn communication skills in the context of the SE project they do in CS2103T. CS2103 is for students who have already taken a different communications course (these are mostly cross-faculty students).<br>
 From our side, we treat both groups of students the same way.
</box>

**Workload:** 4 Units (i.e., workload of 10 hours/week)

**Class size:** (CS2103T: `400` + CS2103: `62` = `462`)

**Topics covered:** are [here](../se-book-adapted/index.html).

# Key components{.text-info}

Here is the grade breakdown:

<pic eager src="gradeBreakdown.png" />

-----------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Lectures{.text-info}

**As CS2103DE is under the PVO's BL2.0 initiative, it is delivered in blended mode.** The primary content delivery mechanism is the online textbook + pre-recorded videos (For example, topics in [Schedule -> Week 7 -> Topics](../schedule/week7/topics.html) page).

The lecture is shorter (about 1 hour), and is used for a 'briefing' only, consisting of two parts:
1. A recap of the previous week's topics e.g., reiterate finer points
1. A preview of next week's topics e.g., motivation, importance, how they fit into the big picture etc.

**The lecture is complementary, and optional.** As most students prefer to watch the recording rather than attend live, ==making the lecture interactive is of low priority==. However, there is an in-lecture quiz students can do during the lecture or while watching the recording.

-----------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Tutorials{.text-info}

**Tutorials are delivered via Zoom.** As most are done by UG tutors, the class size is kept at 10 students per tutor i.e., 46 tutorial sessions per week.

**We use Zoom chat to get _everyone_ to answer _all_ questions** posed during the tutorial. As students answer using private messages, everyone gets to attempt the question without being influenced by others in the class. Although this slows down the tutorial, we do it because research shows that attempting to answer a question before receiving the correct answer enhances retention, even if their own answer was incorrect.

**Tutors are given detailed instructions, and slides to use** in the interest of uniformity. As a quality control measure, tutorial are recorded, and each tutor files a report after the end of each tutorial.

-----------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Individual project (iP){.text-info}

**This is a <tooltip content="created from scratch">greenfield</tooltip> project done in iterative fashion**, meant to build up students' individual competences before they start the team project. Students add features to the product incrementally, while practicing the use of relevant tools such as Java, Git, GitHub, Gradle etc.

**The _mastery learning_ approach is used** i.e., students can keep trying until their work is good enough to earn full marks. The product they build is a chat bot that helps the user with keeping track of tasks.

* The project description starts from [this page](ip-overview.html).
* Final versions of this semester's iPs are in [this page](ip-showcase.html). Same examples given below:

 </tab>
</tabs>

* iP Assessment: As the goal of the iP to ensure students pass a certain bar of competence before starting the team project, the [iP assessment](ip-grading.html) is done almost on an S/U basis. Those who are unable to pass the bar are given more time and more help until they are able to do so -- resulting in almost all students receiving full marks for this component.

-----------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Team project (tP){.text-info}

**This is a <tooltip content="starting with a legacy codebase">brownfield</tooltip> iterative project.** Students start with an existing Java desktop application [Address Book application](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) and evolve/morph it into another product.

In the first half of the semester, students lay the groundwork for the team project, while doing the individual project:<br>
<pic eager src="tpGanttChart-preIterations.png" width="800"></pic>

In the second half of the semester, students build the product in three iterations:<br>
<pic eager src="tpGanttChart-iterations.png" width="800"></pic>

* The project description starts from [this page](tp-overview.html).
* Final versions of previous semester's tPs are in [this page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/website/admin/teamList.html). A few examples are given below:

 </tab>
</tabs>

* tP Assessment: We try to make the tP assessment _outcome-based_. For example, the number of bugs found in a team's code influences the grade more than the number of test cases they wrote. More details are given [here](tp-grading.html).


<box type="info" seamless>

Note that the end product of both projects are not meant to be big, as the project duration is short, the learning curve is steep, and the focus is on learning the tools, processes, techniques, etc. rather than adding a lot of features.
</box>

-----------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Participation{.text-info}

[Participation marks](participation.html) are awarded for actively participating in the course activities. To reduce workload stress, students are given full participation marks if they meet a reasonably low bar of participation (e.g., earn at least half the participation points on offer, in at least 10 weeks). Almost all students are expected to earn full marks for this component.

Students can track their own participation level using a participation dashboard.  [Here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/dashboards//contents/participation.html) is an example (from a previous semester) -- click on the %%{{ icon_info }}%% near the student number to see the details of activities considered.

<box type="info" seamless>

Note that some examples of online dashboards (like the one above) are from a previous semester, because the ones from the current semester takes longer to load (due to the large class size).
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**The use of dashboards brings in an element of _gamification_ to the course**, by framing work as small 'achievements' and making those achievements visible (like a 'leaderboard') to keep students motivated.
</box>

---------------------------------{.dotted .border-info}

## Exam{.text-info}

The final exam is designed to scale to a large class (e.g., minimize manual grading).

There are two main components:

1. **A UML diagram drawing task.**

<div class="indented">
<panel type="info" header="Sample question" minimized>

(a) Sketch a class diagram for the code given below. Also incorporate the following information into the diagram:
* An  `Activity` object can consist of other `Activity` objects i.e., sub-activities.
* A  `Watcher` object may not be associated with more than 5 `Activity` objects.
* `UiWidget` class inherits the `ProgressWatcher`.

```java
class Activity{
    private Watcher[] watchers = new Watcher[ProgressWatcher.MAX];
    //...

    void watch(Watcher w){
        //add w to watchers
    }

    Activity getInstance(){
        //...
    }
}
```
```java
interface Watcher{
    void update(int value);
}
```
```java
abstract class ProgressWatcher implements Watcher{
    static int MAX = 10;
}
```
(b) Sketch an object diagram that has two `Activity` objects `a1` and `a2`, both being watched by a `UiWidget` object `u`. Furthermore, `a2` is a sub-activity of `a1`.

**Model answer:**

<pic eager src="images/sample-uml-drawing-question-answer.png"></pic><p/>

**Explanation:** The purpose of this type of questions is to check if the students can document their code using UML diagrams. Typically, the exam has one question on a UML structure diagram (such as the above question) and another focusing on a behavior diagram (e.g., a UML sequence diagram)
</panel>
</div>
<p/>


2. **MCQ questions, each paired with a 'short answer' question.** Some of the questions are based on the UML diagram drawn in (1) above.

<div class="indented">
<panel type="info" header="Sample question" minimized >

**MCQ question:** Given below are some changes Tom did to his code. Which one is not a refactoring?

- ( ) Tom removes braces around an `if` block because there is only one statement in the block.
- ( ) Tom finds the `sort()` function doesn't work when the list is empty. He adds an exception to handle that case.
- ( ) Tom merges two classes into one bigger class.
- ( ) Tom thinks the `add()` function is too long. He applies the SLAP technique to it.
- ( ) Tom finds that a variable name used is misleading. He changes it to a better name.

**Follow up question:** Why is it not a refactoring?

-----------

**Model Answer**

> - (x) Tom finds the `sort()` function doesn't work when the list is empty. He adds an exception to handle that case.
>
> Reason: Because this alters the behavior (refactoring should not).

**Explanation:** This question checks if the student is able to apply the knowledge of refactoring to a given contest, to distinguish refactoring from other code changes.

</panel>
</div>
<p/>

As the course is heavy on the practice side, it does not contain a heavy/deep theory component. Therefore, the **exam assesses whether students can _fluently_ apply a variety of concepts in a real project context**, by requiring students to answer questions at a rapid pace (e.g., 2 minutes per MCQ + Short answer question pair). The exam is open-book.

# Challenges{.text-danger}

Albeit being academically strong, most our students lack programming experience outside of school courses. Getting them to be ready to work in an actual SE project is a formidable challenge. especially when done at a scale of ~500 students/semester.
Following from the main goal of the course (i.e., preparing students for internships), there are two key requirements that makes CS2103DE harder to run than a typical first SE course:

1. **The need to train students on the iterative software development process**: While the more common approach is for the first SE course to train students on a _sequential_ (i.e., _waterfall_) process and move to an _iterative_ process in the second SE course, this course needs to train students on the more industry-friendly iterative process from the beginning, as some may go for internships before taking a second SE course.
2. **The need to train students to work in both greenfield and brownfield projects**: As internships can involve both types of projects, we need to train students for both.

---------------------------{.dotted .border-danger}

### Challenge 1: Iterative topic delivery can disorient students.{.text-danger}

When following an iterative process in the project, topic coverage itself needs to be iterative i.e., cover basics of all topics first, and go progressively deeper into all topics (in parallel) as the semester progresses. %%Reason: we cannot spend the first few weeks on the topic of _Requirements_ alone because students need to know about design, implementation, testing, etc. when doing their first iteration of the project%%. However, iterative topic coverage results in each topic being delivered as multiple fragments over many weeks, which can disorient students and make it harder for them to see the 'full picture'. The [course timeline](timeline.html) page shows how the course jumps between multiple topics every week.

**Solution: A full-fledged course website to guide students through the course contents.** We built a website authoring tool called [MarkBind](https://markbind.org) that we then used to create the course website. MarkBind is able to present the same content in different ways without duplicating content. Here is an example of how this helps with the disorientation caused by the iterative topic delivery:
 * The topics covered each week are presented as a separate page (e.g., the [Schedule -> Week 7 -> Topics](../schedule/week7/topics.html) page), with additional commentary (in light green boxes) to guide students through the topics.
 * The same content are presented in their logical order in the [Textbook page](../se-book-adapted/index.html). This can be used when students study for exams at the end of the semester, or when when looking up a topic.

---------------------------{.dotted .border-danger}

### Challenge 2: Iterative is hard for beginners.{.text-danger}

Iterative is hard for beginners because there are many things (i.e., design, implementation, testing, etc.) happening at once.

**Solution: Give fine-grained guidance.** In every week, we give detailed guidance on what students should be doing in their project. These tasks are designed to tie in with what they learned so far. Example:
* The page [Schedule -> Week 7 -> Project](../schedule/week7/project.html) explains what to do in the iP (i.e., the individual project) and the tP (i.e., the team project) in that week.
* Starting from [this page](ip-overview.html), the next several pages explains how the individual project needs to progress over the next several weeks.

---------------------------{.dotted .border-danger}

### Challenge 3: Temptation to fake 'iterative'.{.text-danger}

Given the iterative process is a harder to do and requires a consistent effort over the project duration, there is a temptation for students to 'fake' an iterative process and do everything in the last few weeks using a waterfall process.

**Solution: Monitor project progress closely**. We monitor the project progress closely and provide means for students to self-monitor as well. Examples (note: these are from the previous semester; [this semester's ones](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/dashboards/) take longer to load due to bigger class size):

* [The iP progress dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/dashboards/contents/ip-progress.html) shows which individual project tasks each student has done.
* [The iP code dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/ip-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=java~md~fxml~sh~bat~gradle~txt&since=2022-01-14&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=1001mei&tabRepo=1001mei%2Fip%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=java~md~fxml~gradle~txt&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false) shows coding activities in the individual project e.g., the code written by each student and when students committed code.
* [The iP comments dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/dashboards/contents/ip-comments.html) shows code review comments given by students for others' iP code.
* The team project progress is monitored using a similar set of dashboards too ([example](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/dashboards/contents/tp-progress.html)).

---------------------------{.dotted .border-danger}
### Challenge 4: Rigorous project grading is hard.{.text-danger}

Given the large class size, evaluating the projects fairly, uniformly, and rigorously is hard.

**Solutions: Leverage peer evaluations and crowd-sourcing.** One good example is the [practical exam (PE)](tp-pe.html) that we do at the end of the team project. In the PE, each project deliverable is independently tested by 5-6 other students. The testers earn mark by finding bugs in the product they are testing, and the developers lose marks if others find bugs in their product. This motivates students to do an intensive testing of the product and the documentation, but more importantly, motivates them to try to avoid bugs in their own product to begin with.


---------------------------{.thick-1 .border-success}

# Achievements{.text-success}

Given next are some notable achievements of the course.

---------------------------{.dotted .border-success}

### Achievement 1: Concrete evidence of SE competence{.text-success}

At the end of the semester, each student produces, and put on the public domain, the following concrete evidence of their SE competence.

* A small software product built from scratch, together with a User Guide.
* A contribution to a brownfield project, together with a User Guide ([example](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)) and a Developer Guide ([example](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)).

Their work is (e.g., code committed, pull requested reviewed, issues created, updates to documents etc.) available for scrutiny by anyone.

---------------------------{.dotted .border-success}

### Achievement 2: Well-received despite many 'unpopular' choices{.text-success}

This course makes numerous 'unpopular' choices, some of which are given below:

1. **Our approach: Lectures give only a preview of the topics** and the motivation for learning them.<br>
   Rationale: To encourage self-learning at own pace.<br>
   Students prefer: Lectures going through the content in detail.

1. **Our approach: Lectures slides are printer-unfriendly**, optimized for lecture delivery only.<br>
   Rationale: To encourage students to go through the textbook instead of relying on slides as the sole source of contents.<br>
   Students prefer: Slides that can be printed and used as study materials.

1. **Our approach: Tutors are not allowed to give technical help.** We require students to resolve technical issues via the [course forum]({{url_forum}}). Forum use is monitored ([example](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/forum-activities.html)) and rewarded.<br>
   Rationale: To encourage peer support. To wean off students from being too reliant on tutors for solving technical problems.

1. **Our approach: Tutors are not allowed to give specific feedback on students' project work.** Instead, we use alternative means to guide students through the project (e.g., discuss a hypothetical project to figure out common mistakes students make in the project).<br>
   Rationale: To encourage students to make their own project decisions. To avoid tutors influencing the project outcomes.

1. **Our approach: Many deliverables, every week.** This [Summary of the Course Timeline](../schedule/timeline.html) page shows how many project and admin tasks are due in each week. In addition, most weeks have optional in-lecture and in-video quizzes, not forgetting the tutorial tasks ([example](../schedule/week7/tutorial.html)).<br>
   Rationale: To ensure students learn and apply the topics in a timely manner, rather than try to do everything near the end of the semester.

1. **Our approach: Require students to use an existing codebase** for the team project, and a pre-selected tool stack, and follow a prescribed workflow in the project (e.g., follow a [forking workflow](../book/revisionControl/forkingWorkflow/)).<br>
   Rationale: To train students to work with legacy code, and follow workflows used in the industry.<br>
   Students prefer: Full freedom to build whatever product they want, using their preferred tool stack, using simpler worflows (e.g., everyone commits to  the master branch).

1. **Our approach: Get students to test each others' products**, report bugs, and respond to reported bugs.<br>
   Rationale: To achieve a higher rigor in testing the quality of student work.<br>
   Students prefer: Teaching team does all the evaluations.

Despite all the above (and more) unpopoular choices, the course continues to receive good student feedback, even in the face of increasing student numbers. Given below is the student feedback rating for CS2103T (semester 1) across recent years.

<div class="indented-level2">

Year | Class size | Course rating %%(dept average)%% | Teacher rating %%(dept average)%%
-----|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------:
2018 |  113       | 3.8 <small>%%(3.8)%%</small>     | 4.1 <small>%%(4.1)%%</small>
2019 |  117       | 4.0 <small>%%(3.8)%%</small>     | 4.4 <small>%%(4.2)%%</small>
2020 |  242       | 4.0 <small>%%(3.9)%%</small>     | 4.3 <small>%%(4.2)%%</small>
2021 |  294       | 4.2 <small>%%(3.9)%%</small>     | 4.5 <small>%%(4.2)%%</small>
</div>

---------------------------{.dotted .border-success}

### Achievement 3: Scaled up without losing rigor{.text-success}

While SE courses are notoriously hard to scale, we have done reasonably well in scaling this course to 500 students, without a significant drop in rigor of evaluation (thanks to the practical exam), and without a significant increase in teaching resources (e.g., tutor hours).
Strategies used:

1. **Heavy use of automation**: The course uses automation heavily (supported by about 20,000 LoC of Python scripts) e.g., generating dashboards from various sources of data. In addition, the course uses the following EdTech tools that were built by our students primarily to support this course but currently used by other courses as well:
   * [MarkBind](https://markbind.org): Used to create the course website
   * [TEAMMATES](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/): For peer evaluations
   * [RepoSense](https://reposense.org): To generate code dashboards
   * [CATcher](https://catcher-org.github.io): To support the practical exam
   * [se-education.org](https://se-education.org): To provide project templates, tech guides, etc.<p/>

1. **Leverage peer inputs**: Students themselves contribute a lot to guiding/evaluating other students. For example, the iP is graded entirely by scripts and peers, except for a small number of cases (about 5%) that require tutor intervention.

----------------------------{.thick-1}

# Future work

The heavy workload remains a concern (in the [mid-term survey](mid-semester-survey-results.html), about 25% of the respondents said the workload is too heavy).

Providing adequate and personalized help to struggling students is another challenge that becomes harder to do as the class size increases.
