There are no hard-and-fast rules. While some numbers (e.g., 30 LoC, or 3 levels of nesting) may be mentioned as guidelines, it is always a case-by-case decision. For example, a method with 50 LoC may be considered as not 'too long' if its contents are justified or if the costs of shortening it outweigh the benefits.

<div id="faq-tVsNonT-Q">What are the differences between CS2103DE and CS2103/T?</div>
<div id="faq-tVsNonT-A">

**CS2103DE** is an innovative offering by the **College of Design and Engineering (CDE)** as part of the Second Major/Minor in Computing (Design and Engineering), while CS2103/T is offered by the School of Computing.

CS2103DE brings a unique perspective by **integrating design and engineering principles** into software engineering education. This variant is specifically tailored to leverage CDE students' interdisciplinary background, combining their engineering fundamentals with software development practices.

**Key advantages of CS2103DE:**
* **Contextual Learning**: Examples and projects are crafted to resonate with engineering applications, making the content more relevant to CDE students' primary domains
* **Cross-disciplinary Approach**: Emphasizes the intersection of software engineering with design thinking and engineering problem-solving methodologies
* **Tailored Support**: Teaching approach adapted to suit students who may be approaching software engineering from non-computing backgrounds

While all three courses share the same core software engineering concepts and learning outcomes, CS2103DE provides a learning environment that better aligns with the unique perspectives and career trajectories of CDE students pursuing computing as a complementary skillset to their engineering expertise.

Sometimes, small things matter in big ways. e.g., all other things being equal, a job may be offered to the candidate who has the neater looking CV although both have the same qualifications. This may be unfair, but that's how the world works. Students forget this harsh reality when they are in the protected environment of the school and tend to get sloppy with their work habits. That is why we reward all positive behavior, even small ones (e.g., following precise submission instructions, arriving on time etc.).

<div id="faq-umlIsItUsedInIndustry-Q">Is UML even used in the industry? Is there any point learning it?</div>
<div id="faq-umlIsItUsedInIndustry-A">

**UML is not used very frequently by practitioners.** In particular, most would not bother to draw detailed UML diagrams _before_ (or in parallel to) coding.<br>
**UML diagrams can still provide practical value in some situations** e.g., when documenting internal design details, when discussing design alternatives. However, even when using UML is beneficial, some may avoid using it due to lack of proficiency. In fact an average programmer is likely to be able to survive without drawing any UML diagrams, and only occasionally having to interpret UML diagrams drawn by others.

However, **being able to communicate about code/design without referring to actual code is an essential skill**, as the code is not always available %%(e.g., it may not exist yet or the codebase may be too big for to be used for such communications)%%. While in some cases we can use ad hoc notations (simple boxes, arrows, labels) for such communications, using a standard modeling notation can make such communications universally understood. **UML is the leading general-purpose notation used for modelling software design.** It can be used for basic modelling irrespective of the domain of the software project. For more intense modeling needs, we can go for a domain-specific modelling notation %%e.g., Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)%%.<br>

Besides, **UML is just a tool that we use to learn a more fundamental SE skill: the ability to model code visually**, especially at higher abstraction levels. This skill is necessary to be able to build mental models of large code bases in our head, even if you don't actually draw physical diagrams, UML or otherwise.

</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-umlAreWeOverdoing-Q">OK, so there is _some_ value in learning UML. But do we have to spend _so much_ time on it?</div>
<div id="faq-umlAreWeOverdoing-A">

**It is true that we are 'overdoing' UML a bit in this course.** Because UML is not used frequently in the industry (especially, by junior developers), you will not have many chances to learn it 'on the job' in the early part of your career. Hence, **we try to ensure you learn UML well-enough to be able to use it a few years later**, even if you don't get to use it in the interim period.
</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-umlWhenNotationNotEnough-Q">What do we do when the UML notation covered in the course is not enough to model what we want to illustrate?</div>
<div id="faq-umlWhenNotationNotEnough-A">

Here are some options you can consider:

* **Use the closest matching notation**, and use UML notes to provide the missing information.
* **Use an alternative means to communicate** %%(e.g., pseudocode, or even actual code)%%, instead of using a UML diagram.
* **Leave out the complex part from the diagram**, or give a simpler view in the model, if the complex part is not really relevant to the purpose of the diagram (but also mention that the model is a simplified view).

Caution: For course deliverables, it is best not to use UML notations not covered in the course.

<div id="faq-umlWhyNoCorrespondenceBetweenUmlAndCode-Q">Why can't the code and the UML correspond to each other _exactly_, in both directions?</div>
<div id="faq-umlWhyNoCorrespondenceBetweenUmlAndCode-A">

There are several reasons:

* Some design concepts do not have direct translations to a mechanism in the programming language %%e.g., most programming languages do not have a direct way to implement a bidirectional association%%.
* Some programming language constructs might not have corresponding UML constructs %%e.g., lambdas%%
* Some implementations can choose to deviate from the intended design due to other valid reasons such as performance, code clarity, convenience etc.

<div id="faq-umlHowToFindIntendedDesignFromCode-Q">When drawing UML diagrams from the code, how to find the 'intended' design from the code?</div>
<div id="faq-umlHowToFindIntendedDesignFromCode-A">

In a real project, in most cases, the person drawing the diagram is likely to be the same person who wrote the code, which means that person is likely to know the intended design already. If this is not the case, one can try to approximate the intended design based on one's own domain knowledge, consulting domain experts, from other sources such as project documentation (and code comments).

In an exam question, the missing info will be provided as part of the question, _if_ it is relevant to the expected answer.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-narrowProjectScope-Q">Why very narrow project scope?</div>
<div id="faq-narrowProjectScope-A">

Defining your own unique project is more fun.

But, wider scope → more diverse projects → harder for us to go deep into your project. The collective know-how we (i.e., students and the teaching team) have built up about SE issues related to the project become shallow and stretched too thinly. It also affects fairness of grading.

<pic eager src="{{baseUrl}}/admin/images/limited project scope.png" width="772" height="296"/>

That is why a strictly-defined project is more suitable for a first course in SE that focuses on nuts-and-bolts of SE. After learning those fundamentals, in higher level project courses you can focus more on the creative side of software projects without being dragged down by nuts-and-bolts SE issues (because you already know how to deal with them). However, we would like to allow some room for creativity too. That is why we let you build products that are slight variations of a given theme.

Also note: **The freedom to do 'anything' is not a necessary condition for creativity**. Do not mistake being different for being creative. In fact, the more constrained you are, the more you need creativity to stand out.

<div id="faq-favoriteTool-Q">Why can't I use my favorite tool/framework/language etc.?</div>
<div id="faq-favoriteTool-A">

<pic eager src="{{baseUrl}}/admin/images/I'm not allowed to use my favorite tool.png" width="750" height="287"/>

We have chosen a basic set of tools after considering ease of learning, availability, typical-ness, popularity, migration path to other tools, etc. There are many reasons for limiting your choices:

Pedagogical reasons:

* **Sometimes 'good enough', not necessarily the best, tools are a better fit for beginners**: Most bleeding edge, most specialized, or most sophisticated tools are not suitable for a beginner course. After mastering our toolset, you will find it easy to upgrade to such high-end tools by yourself. We do expect you to eventually (after this course) migrate to better tools and, having learned more than one tool, to attain a more general understanding about a family of tools.
* **We want you to learn to thrive under given conditions**: As a professional Software Engineer, you must learn to be productive in any given tool environment, rather than insist on using your preferred tools. It is usually in small companies doing less important work that you get to chose your own toolset. Bigger companies working on mature products often impose some choices on developers, such as the project management tool, code repository, IDE, language etc. For example, Google used SVN as their revision control software until very recently, long after SVN fell out of popularity among developers. Sometimes this is due to cost reasons (tool licensing cost), and sometimes due to legacy reasons (because the tool is already entrenched in their codebase).
 While programming in school is often a solo sport, programming in the industry is a team sport. As we are training you to become professional software engineers, it is important to get over the psychological hurdle of needing to satisfy individual preferences and get used to making the best of a given environment.

Practical reasons:

* Some of the topics are tightly coupled to tools. Allowing more tools means tutors need to learn more tools, which increases their workload.
* We provide learning resources for tools. e.g. 'Git guides'. Allowing more tools means we need to produce more resources.
* When all students use the same tool, the collective expertise of the tool is more, increasing the opportunities for you to learn from each others.

Meanwhile, feel free to share with peers your experience of using other tools.

<div id="faq-manySubmissions-Q">Why so many small submissions?</div>
<div id="faq-manySubmissions-A">

<pic eager src="{{baseUrl}}/admin/images/frequent submissions.png" width="759" height="359"/>

The high number of submissions is not meant to increase workload but to spread it across the semester. Learning theory and applying them should be done in parallel to maximize the learning effect. That can happen only if we spread theory and 'application of theory' (i.e., project work) evenly across the semester.

In addition, spreading the work across the semester aligns with the <tooltip content="revisiting concepts at spaced intervals">'spaced repetition'</tooltip> technique that we apply in this course to increase your retention of concepts learned.

Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you _think_ you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it.

<div id="faq-tutorialWhyZoomInF2f-Q">WHAT? Why use Zoom when we are already F2F?</div>
<div id="faq-tutorialWhyZoomInF2f-A">

Zoom is still needed for the following reasons:

* Screen-sharing the slides. {texts="['(a)', '(b)', '(c)']"}
* Collecting answers via PM or polls.<br>
  **Why insist on answering via PM?** This gives everyone a chance to think about the question and come up with their own answer, without being influenced by others' answers, and without being embarrassed for giving the wrong answer. Research has shown that this _attempt_ at answering increases retention of the correct answer received subsequently, irrespective of the correctness of the answer the student initially came up with.<br>
  As a bonus, this tutorial structure will also give you a good training for the final exam.
* Recording the tutorial for your future reference.<br>
  These recordings also help in improving tutorial quality (e.g., profs can review recordings of tutors and give feedback on how to improve).

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-tutorialByZoom-Q">Are you allowed to attend the tutorial via Zoom instead?</div>
<div id="faq-tutorialByZoom-A">

By default, no.<br>
Reason: it goes against the purpose of F2F tutorials (i.e., to get the whole team to meet physically) and the NUS directive to move all small classes to F2F mode.<br>
However, you can request (by emailing `{{ course | lower }}@comp.nus.edu.sg`) to attend the tutorial of a specific week via Zoom, if you have a valid reason (e.g., MC, taking part in an NUS-related event).

<div id="faq-tutorialWhyF2f-Q">Why we need F2F tutorials? Why not do all tutorials via Zoom?</div>
<div id="faq-tutorialWhyF2f-A">

There are several reasons:

1. NUS policy requires all small classes to be F2F. Physical interaction with peers is an essential part of the university experience.
1. While Zoom is more convenient, they are not as effective in achieving some learning outcomes. For example, we are training you for working in team projects, and in technical communications, both of which sometimes need to be done in the F2F mode.
1. Your physical presence allows the tutor to observe team dynamics better. To give an example, sometimes even a team's seating positions can tell us the level of team cohesion.

Note that we do track your arrival time, as late arrivals hinder your ability to participate in the tutorial fully.

If you anticipate a late arrival due to a reason beyond your control (e.g., due to the previous class ending late), here are some strategies to mitigate the impact:

* Prepare for the tutorial tasks in advance, especially the first one. This will allow you to complete the task in time even if you arrive a few minutes late.
* Join the Zoom meeting while you are on the way to the class.

<div id="faq-warmUpTaskRushed-Q">When doing tutorial task 1, I couldn't update the workspace file before it was downloaded by the tutor. Will I be penalised?</div>
<div id="faq-warmUpTaskRushed-A">

Not to worry; there is no penalty.

We download the workspace file at 10-minutes mark to discourage students from continuing task 1 (which is just a warmup activity) even after task 2 has started, thus not getting the full value of task 2 (which is more important than task 1).

We do use the downloaded workspace files to identify students who consistently come prepared for tutorials and do a good job in tutorial tasks (e.g., when selecting tutors), but we do not penalise students based on those workspace files.

If you frequently find yourself being unable to finish task 1 in time, you can consider doing it in advance.

<div id="faq-tutorialWhyTutorCannotGiveTechHelp-Q">Why tutors are not allowed to give tech help?</div>

The pedagogical reason: Learning how to solve technical problems, and <tooltip content="e.g., explaining the problem well">seek</tooltip>/give/receive help, **are learning outcomes of this course, and are critical skills for software engineers**. So, we want you to practice those things in this course as much as possible.

A practical reason: Unlike in lower-level programming courses, the technical problem you encounter in this course are varied and dependent on your OS and tool choices. It is not possible for one person (e.g. your tutor) to know how to help with problems related to all OS'es and all tools used by students under his/her care. It is more practical to troubleshoot such problems via the course forum, as that gives you a way to get help from all your peers in the class, the entire teaching team, and a group of past students who have volunteered to help current students solve technical problems. Based on past data, we know that more than 90% of the problems posted in the course forum get resolved within 24 hours. So, **by not allowing you to get tech help from tutors, we are directing you to a more effective way to resolve those issues, while learning valuable skills at the same time**.

The size of the target market is not a grading criterion. You can make it as narrow as you want.

<div id="faq-dgDetailsLevel-Q">How detailed the DG should be? Do we have to describe every feature/component?</div>
<div id="faq-dgDetailsLevel-A">

The DG is primarily meant to help current/future developers. In general, the DG is expected to provide minimal yet sufficient guidance  for developers, serving them in the following ways:

* It act as a starting point for developers, before they can dive into the code itself %%e.g., by providing an architecture-level overview of the system%%
* It provides a roadmap to developers %%e.g., pointing out where important information can be found in the code%%
* It complements the code, providing info/perspectives not specified in the code %%(e.g., rationale for high-level design choices, details of dev ops)%%<br>
  or not easy to grasp from the code %%(e.g., architecture level view, visual models)%%.

Therefore, decide based on how the inclusion/exclusion affects that target audience (you belong to the target audience too!) in achieving the above objectives.

**However, everyone is expected to contribute to the DG (and contribute to UML diagram updates)**, which means you should divide the DG-update work among team members.

<div id="faq-noEffectOnUml-Q">What if the features I added don't affect UML diagrams?</div>
<div id="faq-noEffectOnUml-A">

* **We expect all students to have _some_ experience working with DG UML diagrams**, to verify that you are able to handle similar diagramming tools in the future.
* If your code changes don't require updates to existing UML diagrams or adding new diagrams,
  * you can document a 'proposed' feature or a design change that you might do in a future iteration, which gives you an opportunity to add some UML diagrams.
  * Also take a closer look at the features you added -- not needing changes to UML might (but not always) be a sign that the features you added didn't go deep enough. In the context of the tP, it is better to add one big feature, rather than add many small insignificant features.

~~GitHub Issues does not have a direct way of doing this. However, you can use a task list in the issue description to indicate sub-tasks and corresponding issues/PRs -- ([an example](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1774))~~

<div id="faq-githubMultipleIssueAssignees-Q">Is it OK to assign multiple members to the same task?</div>
<div id="faq-githubMultipleIssueAssignees-A">

This is discouraged in the tP, as it makes task allocations (and accountability) harder to track.<br>
Instead, shared tasks can be split into separate issues. For example, instead of creating an issue `Update teams page with own info` and assigning it to all team members (in which case, this issue can't be closed until all members do their part), you can create issues such as `Update teams page with John's info` that can be assigned to individual members.

This is encouraged, while not a strict rule. Creating an issue indicates 'a task to be done', while a PR is 'a task being done'. These are not the same, and there can be a significant time gap between the two.<br>
 Furthermore, posting an issue in advance allows the team to,

* anticipate a PR is coming
* discuss more about the task (in the issue thread) e.g., alternatives, priority
* indicate who will be doing the task (by adding an assignee), when it should be done (by adding it to a milestone)

</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-tpPrReviewRigor-Q">How thorough should the PR reviews be?</div>
<div id="faq-tpPrReviewRigor-A">

**Course admin perspective:** It's up to you. We do not directly enforce any requirement on this. How well you do this can affect your grade indirectly though e.g., if PR reviews are weak, low quality code could get merged, which can in turn affect grading for code quality and bugs in the product. If you 'overdo' PR reviews, you'll waste time/effort and slow down the progress, which can affect marks as well.

**Teaching/learning perspective:** Learning to optimize the _process_ is an intended learning outcome. You can do this iteratively. That is, the team can decide your own policy/process, and tweak it as you go. For example, you can decide to have a minimum of n reviews at rigor level X for each PR. After doing that for a while, you can evaluate how it is working, and tweak if necessary (reduce n or lower X if you feel like it is slowing down the project too much without helping to increase quality that much | increase n or set a higher X if you think the code being merged is below-par quality).

**SE perspective:** This depends on many things, such as target quality (higher target quality requires high rigor PR reviews), availability of reviewers, level of other quality assurance mechanisms in place (e.g., automated checks done on the code, such as Checkstyle). Might even vary based on type of PR (some PRs need closer scrutiny than others).

Should reviewer run the code locally to ensure the code works? This also depends on if (and how well) the work in the PR is covered by automated tests run by the CI.

Most long-running projects in real world will establish their own policies/norms, either written down formally or passed down informally (i.e., new devs follow what current devs do).

<div id="faq-tpMultiStepCmd-Q">Why not allow user to input the command one field at a time?</div>
<div id="faq-tpMultiStepCmd-A">

While this _multistep-command_ approach (i.e., giving the user a series of prompts to enter various data elements required to perform an action) has its benefits (e.g., no need to memorize the command format), a deeper look reveals why the _one-shot-command_ approach is better.

Before delving any further, note how leading CLI-centric software such as Git and Linux don't use the multistep approach either. Why?

The multistep approach basically results in a 'text-based GUI simulation' that is harder to use than an actual GUI (obviously), whereas a well-designed CLI in an expert's hands can perform tasks faster than an equivalent GUI (which is what we are going for). A person good at typing and remembers the command can type a command faster than a user going through a type-read-type-read sequence required by the multistep-command. Now imagine user made a mistake in the response to an earlier prompt -- correcting that would take a lot more work.

That being said, multistep commands can complement the one-shot-command approach in specific cases e.g.,

* as a crutch for new users to learn the command format
* to be used for rarely-used tasks or tasks requiring multiple steps (e.g., importing data from a file)

<div id="faq-tpRationaleForCurrentDesign-Q">When refactoring AB3 code, I would like to find the rationale for the current design; how do I do that?</div>
<div id="faq-tpRationaleForCurrentDesign-A">

First, kudos for wanting to find the rationale before you change the current design. It's a good application of the [Chesterton's Fence Principle](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/).

Some options:

1. See if the rationale is documented in the developer documentation or code comments.
1. Dig into the Git and GitHub history to find if there are any clues there e.g. commit message of the relevant commit, or the discussion in the relevant PR. Git _blame_ feature can help you locate the relevant commit.
1. Try to speculate the possible motives, get views from other developers.
1. These days, you can also ask AI tools.
1. Play it safe and delay the refactoring until you have worked with the code for a while, in case the reason becomes apparent after working with the code for a while.
1. Tentatively refactor it, to see the effect. Sometimes this helps you discover why the code was in the original form in the first place.
1. Go ahead and refactor it, but do it in a way it can be easily reverted later e.g., break the refactoring into a series of small/medium stand-alone design changes and do them as separate PRs (or separate commits) so that they can be reverted later, if needed.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-tpMustWrite300Loc-Q">Is it a must to write at least 300 LoC?</div>
<div id="faq-tpMustWrite300Loc-A">

Note that 300 LoC is neither a target, nor a cap, nor a definitive measure. In fact, LoC is not a very reliable measure of effort. So, it is just a secondary indicator you can refer to. The primary indicator you should keep an eye on is if your tP implementation effort, which is expected to be around 50% of the iP implementation effort.

So, the answer is, "not necessarily". It depends on the effort required, which in turn depends on what the code does. It is quite possible for 100 LoC that implements feature X to take more effort than 300 LoC that implements feature Y (i.e., it depends on the feature). So, we measure the effort, not LoC (LoC figure given is just a rough estimate of the _equivalent_ effort).

</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->
<div id="faq-tpIsBlankLinesCounted-Q">300 LoC is with or without blank lines?</div>
<div id="faq-tpIsBlankLinesCounted-A">

It does not matter. Peg your implementation effort to about 50% of the implementation effort of the iP. Let the LoC number fall where it may. We grade based on the effort, not the LoC count. The given LoC number is just a secondary indicator only.

<div id="faq-tpFullMarksFor300Loc-Q">Still, if I write 300 LoC, I get full marks for implementation?</div>
<div id="faq-tpFullMarksFor300Loc-A">

There is no such guarantee, for two reasons:

1. Your implementation effort is graded based on how much functionality your team produced (based on peer-testers' and tutors' estimates) and how much of that work was contributed by you (based on team members' estimates). For example, simply copy-pasting 400+ LoC with only minor modifications is unlikely to meet this bar as it is less than an effort _equivalent_ to writing a typical 300-400 LoC (or half of a typical iP effort).
1. Implementation marks are based on both effort and quality, the latter being the primary driver (more info <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:tPexpectations-implementationGrading">here</trigger>). So, meeting the effort bar doesn't guarantee full marks for implementation.

Not surprisingly, a common question tutors receive is "can you look at our project and tell us if we have done enough to get full marks?". Here's the answer to that question:

**The tP _effort_ is graded primarily based on peer judgements** (tutor judgements are used too). That means you will be judging the effort of another team later, which also means you should be able to make a similar judgement for your own project now. While we understand effort estimating is hard for software projects, it is an essential SE skill, and we must practice it when we can.

**The expected minimum bar to get full marks for _effort_** is given <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:mid13-effortBar"> here</trigger>.

Then you can do the following:

* Ignore those warnings, and merge the PR (a member with admin permissions can merge a CI-failing PR). Suitable for cases such as,
  * the coverage drop is in code that is not normally covered by automated tests and/or 'not worth the effort to' test automatically (e.g., GUI).
  * you deem that automated testing of that part of the code can be done at a later time (i.e., not a priority at the current time).
* Alternatively, update tests until the coverage is raised back to  sufficient level.

Note that Codecov is there to help you manage code coverage -- it is not graded. You may lower the test coverage targets set for Codecov as well.

While doing PRs against a separate 'feature branch' is not explicitly prohibited, it is discouraged because the longer you keep evolving a feature away from the main code base, the more,

* it brings in elements of a _depth-first iterative_ approach (instead of the intended _breadth-first iterative_ approach). Although technically you are doing multiple features in parallel, they are not synchronized with each other.<br>
  Note: **The ability to divide implementation work into small breadth-first incremental changes is one of the important intended learning outcomes we are aiming for** -- even more important than the mechanics of following the workflow correctly. Using feature branches is not aligned with this learning outcome.
* it moves towards [_big-bang integration_]({{ baseUrl }}/book/integration/approaches/bigBangVsIncremental/) (instead of the intended _incremental integration_) and [_late-and-one-time integration_]({{ baseUrl }}/book/integration/approaches/lateVsEarly/) (instead of the intended _early-and-frequent_ integration).

So, even if you use feature branches,

* do it in moderation (not as the standard practice), only when you feel it is necessary.
* merge the feature branch to the `master` branch frequently, ==at least once per iteration==.<br>

Reasons:

* To show that you have examined, understood, and agree with, the current behavior of those features.
* AB3 does not have a feature spec covering those features (and the UG does not cover all details of a feature).

But you may copy-paste parts of the UG onto your feature spec if that helps.
Also, you may omit existing AB3 feature that are not _must-have_, and hence, need not be included in the MVP.

<div id="faq-githubIssuesMultipleDocAuthors-Q">When all members are updating the same document, can we create one issue and assign it to all?</div>
<div id="faq-githubIssuesMultipleDocAuthors-A">

**A:** In the tP (in which our grading scripts track issues assigned to each member), it is better to create separate issues so that each person's work can be tracked separately. For example, suppose everyone is expected to update the User Guide (UG). You can create separate issues based on which part of the UG will be updated by which person e.g., `List-related UG updates` (assigned to John), `Delete-related UG updates` (assigned to Alice), and so on.

<div id="faq-tpEncryptDataFile-Q">Is it OK to encrypt the data file?</div>
<div id="faq-tpEncryptDataFile-A">

  Generally, not recommended. It can be allowed only if the application provides an easy way to decrypt the file, and encrypt it again after editing it manually.

  Followup question: What if the data in the file is confidential, and therefore, it is risky to leave it in plaintext format?<br>
  While this is a valid concern, you can assume/require that the app is used in a secure environment in which data are protected by default e.g., a personal computer already password protected.

<div id="faq-tpOneMemberNotDone-Q">What if a team member has not done this task? Can the rest proceed?</div>
<div id="faq-tpOneMemberNotDone-A">

If a team member fails to do this within a reasonable time, try to help that team member with this task, if needed. Failing that, the rest of the team can proceed with the remainder of the task. In the latter case, inform the tutor that you are proceeding with this task without waiting for that team member.

<div id="faq-tpUpdateTestsWithCode-Q">Do we have to update tests when we update functional code?</div>
<div id="faq-tpUpdateTestsWithCode-A">

**In very early iterations,** ==try to keep the existing tests (and CI) working==. It is OK not to add new tests.

**In general,** there are several options you can choose from:

1. Update/add tests every time you change functional code. This is what normally happens in stable production systems. For example, most OSS projects will not accept a PR that has failing tests or not enough new tests to cover the new functional code.
2. Disable failing tests temporarily until the code is stable. This is suitable when the functional code is in a highly volatile state (e.g., you are still experimenting with the implementation). The benefit is that you avoid the cost of writing tests for functional code that might change again soon after. Some costs: (a) harder to detect regressions during the period tests are disabled (b) testing debt piles up which could distort your estimate of real progress (c) forgetting to enable the tests in time.<br>
  This is still a viable option during some stages of a tP e.g., during the early part of an iteration, or while a PR is still in 'draft' state (i.e., for getting early feedback from the team).
4. Decide certain tests are not worth the effort to maintain, and delete them permanently. Result: Less test code to maintain but higher risk of undetected regressions.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpUpdateDocsWithCode-Q">Do we need to update user/developer guides to match code changes?</div>
<div id="faq-tpUpdateDocsWithCode-A">

**In general**, it is better for a PR to update code, tests, and documentation together.

**In early iterations**, it is fine not to update documentation, to keep things simple. We can start updating docs in a later iteration, when the code is more stable.
</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpWhyUpdateDiagramsEarly-Q">Why not wait till the end to add/update the DG diagrams?</div>
<div id="faq-tpWhyUpdateDiagramsEarly-A">

Here are some reasons:
* We want you to take at least two passes at documenting the project so that you can learn how to evolve the documentation along with the code %%(which requires additional considerations, when compared to documenting the project only once)%%.
* It is better to get used to the documentation tool chain early, to avoid unexpected problems near the final submission deadline.
* It allows receiving early self/peer/instructor feedback.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpMustWeFixAllBugs-Q">Must we fix all bugs reported and all enhancements suggested by testers?</div>
<div id="faq-tpMustWeFixAllBugs-A">

Not necessarily. Choose based on importance.

In any project, there are always things that can be done 'if there was more time'. If fixing a certain bug has low impact on users, and fixing it is not as important as the work done (or intend to do in the current iteration), you can justify not fixing it with the reason 'not in scope' of the current iteration.

Similarly, a missing feature enhancement can be justified as 'not in scope' if implementing that could have taken resources away from other important project tasks.

Bugs and possible enhancements 'not in scope' will not be penalized.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpDgKeepingProposedFeatures-Q">Can we remove 'proposed features' sections in the DG?</div>
<div id="faq-tpDgKeepingProposedFeatures-A">

Yes, you may remove them, but you are welcome to keep them too (they can be useful if a team member is unable to find any other UML diagram to update).

If you keep them in the DG, update them to match the current version of the product. Otherwise, outdated content can be reported as DG bugs.

</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpCountingSimilarPlannedEnhancements-Q">When listing 'Planned Enhancements' in the DG, if enhancement X and Y are very similar, can we count them as one?</div>

Only if adding one automatically adds the other. If one can be added without the other, they are counted as two enhancements.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpFeatureTakeovers-Q">What if someone took over a feature from another team member?</div>
<div id="faq-tpFeatureTakeovers-A">

In terms of effort distribution, it's up to the team to tell us who did how much. Same goes for assigning bugs. So, it's fine for someone to take over a feature if the team is able to estimate the effort of each member, and they have a consensus on who will be responsible for bugs in that feature.<br>
For code authorship, only one person can claim authorship of a line, and that person will be graded for the code quality of that line. By default, that will be the last person who edited it (as per Git data) but you can [override that behavior using `@@author` tags](tools.html#tool-reposense-for-authorship-tracking).
</div>
<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpFeatureDesignChoice-Q">How to choose between feature design choices?</div>
<div id="faq-tpFeatureDesignChoice-A">

Product design is hard (harder than programming). Feature design choices %%(e.g., to support sorting or not support sorting, sort descending or ascending, which sort order should be default, etc.)%% are subjective and is case-by-case.

General guidance: Choose by considering<br>
 **[A] what is best for the user** (specifically, with reference to the target user profile you chose for the product), but also factor in<br>
 **[B] what is _possible_ within your resources** (e.g., time, manpower, expertise) -- what is 'ideal' may not be practical.

**Implications for the practical exam (PE):**

<div class="indented-level1">

Keeping in mind that during the PE testers can file bug reports against design choices, whatever choice you make, be prepared to justify your choice (based in [A] and [B] above) in case a tester filed a bug report objecting to the current design.

Given these justifications are subjective, if both the developer's justification and the tester's justification seems to be equally valid, we will rule in favor of the developer (i.e., no penalty for the developer).

However, if the dev team went with an inferior choice while another superior choice could have been taken using roughly the same amount of resources, the current design choice is flawed. %%For example, if 'sorting items in ascending order by default' is clearly the better choice, but the dev team chose descending order to be the default, assuming implementing either order takes roughly the same amount of resources, the dev team's design choice is flawed.%%

<div id="faq-tpHowMuchCodeInV12-Q">How much code changes is 'enough' for this iteration?</div>
<div id="faq-tpHowMuchCodeInV12-A">

The bar is, each member to merge at least one PR containing functional code changes. The more you do in the current iteration, the less you need to do in future iteration. So, try to do as much as your time/resources allow. But the more important thing in `{{ version_first }}` is to do those changes in small steps, without breaking the codebase.

<div id="faq-tpDivideByComponent-Q">Is it OK if different members modified different components?</div>
<div id="faq-tpDivideByComponent-A">

No, we advise against that. Instead, divide the work based on features/enhancements instead of components.
But you should still allocate different members to be 'in charge of' different components.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpOtherDiagrammingTool-Q">Instead of PlantUML, can I use some other tool?</div>
<div id="faq-tpOtherDiagrammingTool-A">

Yes, you may use any other tool too (e.g., PowerPoint). But wait; if you do, note the following:

* ==Choose a diagramming tool that has some 'source' format that can be version-controlled using git and updated incrementally== %%(reason: because diagrams need to evolve with the code that is already being version controlled using git)%%. For example, if you use PowerPoint to draw diagrams, also commit the source PowerPoint files so that they can be reused when updating diagrams later.
* Use the same diagramming tool for the whole project, except in cases for which there is a _strong_ need to use a different tool due to a shortcoming in the primary diagramming tool. %%Do not use a mix of different tools simply based on personal preferences.%%

So far, PlantUML seems to be the best fit for the above requirements.

<div id="faq-tpIdeGeneratedDiagrams-Q">Can <tooltip content="i.e., automatically reverse engineered from the Java code">IDE-generated</tooltip> UML diagrams be used in project submissions?</div>
<div id="faq-tpIdeGeneratedDiagrams-A">

Not a good idea. Given below are three reasons each of which can be reported by evaluators as 'bugs' in your diagrams, costing you marks:

* They often don't follow the standard UML notation (e.g., they add extra icons).
* They tend to include _every_ little detail whereas we want to limit UML diagrams to important details only, to improve readability.
* Diagrams reverse-engineered by an IDE might not represent the actual design as some design concepts cannot be deterministically identified from the code %%e.g., differentiating between multiplicities `0..1` vs `1`, composition vs aggregation%%.

<div id="faq-tpLowMidtermPeerEvaluations-Q">What if I don't agree with the tP peer evaluations I received for the midterm peer evaluation?</div>
<div id="faq-tpLowMidtermPeerEvaluations-A">

This round is for your info only (i.e., no direct impact on grades). After the final tP peer evaluation session (which is done at the end of the semester, and can affect the tP grading) results are published, you will get a chance to submit your objections if you don't agree with the evaluations you received.

{{ icon_tip }}eceiving 'lower than expected' feedback early is a good thing; it shows in which areas your team members are less-happy about your contribution/conduct, while there is still time to take corrective actions. It is much worse when team members give good ratings about aspects they are unhappy about, just to avoid conflict, and hold back the negative feedback until the project is over -- in such cases you will be taken by surprise (hey! I thought everything was fine!!) with no time left to rectify the problem.

<!-- =============================================================== -->

<div id="faq-tpGuiTestAutomation-Q">Should we try to automate GUI testing as well?</div>
<div id="faq-tpGuiTestAutomation-A">

Automated GUI testing is hard, especially in Desktop apps, especially in CI (because the environment that CI runs doesn't have a display device to show the GUI).

A few years ago, we used [AB4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/) as the starting point of the tP.

* The main difference between AB4 and AB3? AB4 has automated GUI testing. It used the TestFX tool to do so, and ran the test in 'headless' mode in CI (i.e., simulate a display device without an actual display device).
* The main reason we changed tP to start with AB3 code was that some students found it too hard to maintain those GUI tests.

While we don't require you to automate GUI testing in your tP (i.e., it is fine to do only manual GUI testing), you are welcome to give it a try too, especially if you like a technical challenge.

* Even if you get it working in only some OS'es only, and only in local environment, it is still a useful way to test the GUI quickly.
* It is possible to run tests selectively, which means you can still run them in environments they work and skip them in other environments.

Feel free to reuse/refer AB4 code too. If you manage to make some headway in this direction, you are encouraged to share it with others via the forum.

<div id="faq-tpWorksLocallyFailsCi-Q">All tests pass locally, but the same code fails CI in the PR. How come?</div>
<div id="faq-tpWorksLocallyFailsCi-A">

First, check which OS it is failing in. Some behaviors can be OS-dependent. For example, file paths are case-insensitive in Windows but not in Unix/Mac.

Second, note that PR CI does a temporary merge of `master` branch to the PR branch before running tests, to verify if the checks will pass _after_ you merge this PR. So, if the `master` branch has progressed after you started your PR branch, those new commits can affect the CI result. The remedy is to pull the `master` branch to your repo, merge it to your PR branch, and run tests again (which should fail as well, but you can now find the reason for the failure and fix it).
</div>

<div id="faq-tpPrPassCiButFailedAfterMerging-Q">PR passed CI before merging, but fails CI after merging. How come?</div>
<div id="faq-tpPrPassCiButFailedAfterMerging-A">

It is possible that the `master` branch has received new commits after your PR passed CI the last time. So, if GitHub indicates that your PR is not up-to-date with the latest `master` branch, synchronize your PR branch with the `master` branch (which will run the CI again) before merging it.
</div>

<div id="faq-tpRenameAbReferences-Q">Do we need to change all class/package names that refer to AB3?</div>
<div id="faq-tpRenameAbReferences-A">

Given your product is supposed to be an address book variant, it is fine to keep using 'AddressBook' in class/package names.<br>
But remember to change any user-visible mention of AddressBook at places where the user _expects_ to see the name of your product, and will be confused by seeing a different name instead.

Caution: Mass renaming can disrupt authorship tracking. So, it is best to do any mass renaming at earlier stages of the tP (but you are still _allowed_ to rename them even at later stages).

<div id="faq-tpPeEndTime-Q">What time does the PE end?</div>
<div id="faq-tpPeEndTime-A">

<div id="faq-tpTestingLessBuggyProducts-Q">Some students will be testing less/more buggy products than others? Isn't that unfair?</div>
<div id="faq-tpTestingLessBuggyProducts-A">

As each product is tested by 4-5 testers, after all PE bugs have been finalized, we know how 'buggy' each product is. We then use that information for calculating your PE-related marks. So, the marks are calibrated to match the bugginess of the product you tested.

<div id="faq-tpNeedToFindAllBugs-Q">What if the product I tested is very buggy? Am I expected to find all those bugs?</div>
<div id="faq-tpNeedToFindAllBugs-A">

No. Given the PE has only a short time, we don't expect you to find _all_ bugs in the product. To get full marks, you only need to report a certain percentage of the bugs (e.g., half), or a certain quantity of bugs (the quantity also factors in the nature of the bug e.g., severity), whichever is lower.

<div id="faq-tpMoreCodeMeansHigherPenalty-Q">So, those who write more code will be hit with more bugs? How's that fair?</div>
<div id="faq-tpMoreCodeMeansHigherPenalty-A">

Penalty for bugs is applied based on bug _density_, not bug count. Here's an example:

* `n` bugs found in Ann's feature; it is a big feature consisting of a lot of code → marks for dev testing: 4
* `n` bugs found in Jim's feature; it is a small feature with a small amount of code → marks for dev testing: 1

Although both had the same number of bugs, as Ann's work has a lower bug density than Jim's, she earns more marks for the dev testing aspect.

A bug is a bug irrespective of the label used. Instead of rejecting, rectify the label.

<div id="faq-tpTesterAddingMoreInfoLater-A">

Yes, you may. Given that the dev team did not get to see this additional info when they triaged the bug, the weight such additional info adds to your case is lower than if you had that info in the initial bug report. Nevertheless, it can still help your cause, especially if the dev team should have thought about that info on their own, even if they were missing in the initial bug report.

<div id="faq-tpPeAccuracyForNotInScope-Q">If the bug I reported is `NotInScope`, how does it affect my accuracy bonus?</div>
<div id="faq-tpPeAccuracyForNotInScope-A">

A bug that is `type.Accepted` or `type.NotInScope` can boost your accuracy if the `severity.*` you chose matches the eventual `severity.*` of the bug. ~~Same for `type.*`~~ (the `type.*` will not be considered for accuracy).

The standard operation procedure for digital exams: Some venues have charging points within reach of every seat. If that's not the case, you will be moved to another location with a charging point when your laptop power level reaches a low level.

**Reasons:**

1. **To minimize opportunities for collusion or over-the-shoulder copying** from others (the risk of the latter is higher in this type of exam due to the upright exam device screens being easily visible to other exam takers).<br>
1. **Not unreasonable for the materials tested, nature of the questions, and the proficiency level expected** -- i.e., when using this knowledge in a real life SE project discussion, it will be rare for you to go back to revise what you said earlier in the discussion, nor will you be able to 'answer the easy questions first and come back to harder questions later'.<br>
  Note that you are allowed to go back and modify diagrams you drew in part 1, just like in a real life project scenario.

Not to worry; we understand that this restriction can make the exam feel 'harder' than otherwise. We have the following **measures to compensate:**

* **There is a buffer of two extra questions**, to cushion the impact of making a mistake in question, realizing it later, and not being able to go back to fix it. {{ bullet_tick_green }}
* **There is a buffer of six extra minutes** (on top of the two extra questions), to cushion the impact of needing to spend extra time on a question to ensure the answer is correct before moving to the next question.
* **The question difficulty is calibrated to match this mode of testing** i.e., the questions are easy enough that can be done one shot in a short time.
* **Our tutorials prepare you for this mode of testing** (provided you do them sincerely), as our tutorials get you to answer a series of small MCQ-like questions and short-answer questions.
