Good to see most of you found the course briefing videos useful. Previously, course admin info used to be
covered during weekly briefings, but since a year ago we started extracting them out as a separate
category of videos called 'course briefing' videos.

Glad to see most found weekly briefings to be useful.

A general note: Unlike most courses that use lectures as the _primary_ mechanism for delivering course content, 
 our weekly briefings serve as a _complementary_ 'top up', covering additional examples,
 motivations behind the topics, commentary on how to shape your attitudes related to the subject,
 anecdotes, etc.
Hence, you can skip weekly briefings (or simply speed-watch the recording later) if you 
 are short of time or if you think they are not useful to you.
 Even the in-briefing quiz questions are 'optional' in the sense they are unlikely to make a
 difference in your final participation marks.<br>
 **:fas-exclamation: Caveat: Totally ignoring weekly briefings will disqualify you from future CS2103DE 
 tutor positions**
 though, as we do not want to employ as a tutor someone who hasn't received the _full view_ of the course.

The feedback for the course website is quite positive but there are still _some_ areas to improve further.
  Thanks for your feedback on those. We will continue to try and improve the website whenever we can.<br>
  In the meantime, we thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either.

**Common complaint: too much to read!** It is true that our course website has a LOT more text content
 than one would expect. Some of it was added because at some point a student needed that (e.g., a student
 asks for some information that we realize is not present in the website -- so we add it).
 We do try to arrange the content in a way that is easier to navigate/consume, but it is hard, and I'm
 sure the current format and the level of details do not fit some of you.<br>
 **We also realize some are less inclined to absorb information via the text medium** (preferring other mediums
 such as demos, videos). We try to provide alternative formats as well -- we'll try to do more. 
 Note that the text format also has the advantage that it is the format you'll be referring to
 during the exam.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


Admittedly, if you are someone who normally prepare well for the tutorials and actively take part
 in tutorial discussions, our tutorials can feel slow, less efficient, or less active. 
 We hope you still bear with us because ==the tutorial structure 
  (like many other things in this course)
  aims to _raise the lower bar of the whole class_, which is important when there is a major team project
  (to reduce the skill gap between team members)==.
  * **We had to move to F2F mode**, to comply with NUS
    policy. Although online tutorials seem like a more 'efficient' mode (e.g., no need for travel), we expect physically
    meeting with team members often will have some intangible benefits for you in the long run.<br>
    We still use Zoom out of necessity (e.g., to share slides, to collect answers), and to get the best of
    both modes (e.g., to have a recording of the tutorial).<br>
  * **Having two tutorials in the same venue is not ideal**, but we have no choice due to lack of enough
    small venues. So, it is a compromise we've made to keep tutor-to-student ratio low while making do with the
    current venues we have. 
  * **We start with a 10-minute warm up** to give everyone at least a chance to familiarize with the tutorial tasks
    even if they haven't had time to look at them earlier (we don't want them to be left out entirely).
  * **By requiring _everyone_ to respond via private messages**, we aim to get everyone to _think_ about the topic
    at hand and attempt to answer without being biased by others’ answers.
    Pedagogy research has shown that this act of thinking/attempting
    before receiving the correct answer increases the effectiveness of learning,
    even if you get the answer wrong at first.<br>
    That said, we do want to have some verbal discussions to happen too. That's why we ask you to do the follow up
    discussions verbally.
  * **We monitor tutorial participation** because tutorials are used for ensuring that you all have achieved the desired
    learning targets for the week. If not, slower students tend to neglect the theory part 
    (in a misguided attempt to save time) and try to brute-force the project work, which wastes even more time,
    and also exacerbates the skill-gap problems in their teams.
  * **Less is more, hopefully**: So, while our tutorials only discuss a small number of relatively simpler questions,
    _getting everyone to answer almost every question on the spot_ 
    has ==a higher total learning gain for the entire class,
    although the learning gain for stronger students may be less than usual==.<br>
    So, if you are one of the
    stronger students getting less out of our tutorials than you are used to get from other courses, we hope
    you'll be generous and take a 'hit' here to allow your classmates to level up. You might even benefit yourself
    from their levelled-up contributions when you work with them in the team project.

**:fas-comment: My comments:**


The pace seems to be an issue for some of you, although it seems to be manageable for most.<br>
**We need to go through topics faster than other courses** because you need to have some time left
 _after_ covering a topic to apply that knowledge into the project. 
 So, we need to finish covering topics about 2 weeks before the tP
 finishes, which means ==compressing 13-weeks worth of topics into about 10 weeks== 
 (having the lecture on Friday means we also lose most of the week 1 too). 
Don't worry if you feel like the course is moving too fast; thanks to the iterative approach we use for covering topics,
 you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.

The most common concern about this course is the workload. As per the responses tally above, it seems
fewer students chose `*.5` options. So, given below is the view if we merge `n` and `n.5` bars.

Either way, it is interesting to see peaks around 4, 6, and 8, showing a big variation of how students
perceive the workload of this course.

**Why some students feel the workload as MUCH higher compared to others?** 
Here's a recap of the possible reasons for this that I mentioned during the Week 2->3 briefing:

1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are doing more work than others.**<br>
   Response: If this is because you are doing the course more sincerely (e.g., not skipping even optional
   topics/tasks), it will pay off (i.e., you'll learn more) but you still might want to re-calibrate the time
   you spend on this course if you don't have enough time for other courses.<br>
   If this is because you are unaware of ways to reduce the workload (e.g., omitting optional topics),
   refer to the recommendations given further below.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You need more time than others to complete course tasks**
   because you are an inexperienced coder.<br>
   Response: The good news is, you are getting more value from this course than others (your skills will
   improve a lot more from the course compared to others). But it is unavoidable that there is a price to pay
   (i.e., the extra time you spend on the course). If this is affecting your other courses, you might want to
   to cut down the work you do in the course, with the understanding that your skill improvement will be less too.
1. **%%Possible reason:%% You are taking short-cuts** (e.g., not doing weekly topics before you attempt weekly
   project tasks) to save time, but end up spending even more time as you lack the knowledge needed
   to do the task. For example, we noticed some who didn't do the JavaFX tutorial first ran into problems
   when doing iP Level-10, and wasted a lot of time troubleshooting them.<br>
   Response: This is concerning, and ill-advised (it results in a lose-lose outcome -- less learning, more time wasted).
   Instead, to reduce the time spent on this course without loosing too much value, follow our instructions/schedule
   closely, but omit optional topics/tasks and stop when you have reached the minimum requirement.


**We know the workload concern is real**, and we firmly believe that no course should take more than
    its fair share of students' time. This course aims to teach you SE skills that take a lot
    of practice, which makes the workload feel heavy, especially if you are a beginner coder.<br>
  On our side, ==we have lowered the bar for the tP implementation component by half==
  in recent semesters, and we have further cut down the tP documentation requirement recently. 
  Hopefully, it'll make the workload of the second half lighter than in previous rounds.

**Some recommendations for you:**
  * If you struggled with the iP workload, don’t be too ambitious with the tP.<br>
    Reminder: there are no marks allocated for marking the product interesting, unique, cool, etc.<br>
    Also, keep in mind that it is the quality that will count more than the quantity. 
    In most cases the quantity is graded on an S/U basis.
    Aim to do less but do it really well.<br>
    ==Plan to add/update tP features in small steps== (each step leading to a usable and slightly better version
    of the feature), so that you can stop any time the workload seems to be exceeding what you are prepared for.
  * If you don't have time to study all topics, use the 
    [topic levels system](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/admin/courseExpectations.html#topic-levels:~:text=things%20to%20do.-,Topic%20Levels,-We%20use%20a)
    to figure out which topics are higher priority.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Glad to hear you are gaining practical knowledge. Agreed, the workload can feel a bit uneven across weeks at times. The pace a student can go and the heaviness of the workload varies by the student too.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Don't worry, we don't expect you to do a 'perfect' job the first time. This course is all about incremental improvements. Instead of following a model answer (there are rarely such 'model answers' in software engineering), we want you to develop skills through experience. For example, when writing the MVP feature spec, you simply try to define the behavior as precisely as you can. We already suggest that you should think about which characters are allowed in person names -- you are then expected to think of cases such as 'John s/o Doe' on your own, without having specifically asked to. If you miss something, you'll discover it along the way (in later weeks), and the experience will help you become less prone to similar mistakes in future projects.<br>

Also, try to distribute the tP work among team members. If you have to do all the repo setup and also worry about the full MVP spec, it can feel like 'too much' work.</markdown>

<markdown>The F2F + Zoom is slightly awkward and seems redundant. I guess undergrads should be competent enough to take charge of their learning and have an answer in their mind for questions, not a fan of the wait for 1 min for everyone to answer in the zoom chat during a F2F tutorial (its fine for a virtual one)

Our stance, for both the iP and the tP, is "the product is you (i.e., the student); the software is a byproduct". So, we try to make the product (i.e., you) better by using the iP/tP to teach you as many things as possible, even if it means taking detours and doing the same thing in different ways (e.g., CLI vs GUI).</markdown>

<markdown>A major gripe I have up till now about this course is the steep incline in its pace over the initial weeks, where the first few iP increments are very straightforward for students who would all have completed CS2030S and CS2040S, yet they rise in terms of difficulty by Week 3 suddenly to incorporating built automation tools, JavaFX and UML each per week. As this course understandably emphasises breadth-first iterative learning, I earnestly believe it would benefit most of the cohort to already start off with snippets of these core concepts even earlier on starting from Week 1 possibly. This would also help make the learning gradient more manageable, considering its most probable target audience i.e. Year 2 undergraduates are pacing their CS2103T with some other heavy Level 2k courses, particularly CS2109S and CS2106. The lessons have been conducted quite clearly and the passion exuded by the course staff are very evident though. Thanks!</markdown>

<markdown>the topic on GUI is very rushed and very heavy. got to admit I looked at the GUI steps ahead of time and my brain just blanked out and i just procrastinated for two weeks cause I didn't want to touch GUI at all. then I talked to one of my classmates and he said it is very crazy at how much is being thrown at us but copying the given code is good enough. so i picked back up and even with that, the amount of stuff entering my brain feels a bit overloaded. Thanks though, if not for the code examples, I probably would not even have completed my IP because GUI is that daunting.

But I also understand that GUI could be probably half a module on it's own, if taught in depth, so for it to be in a week, I think it's great that the course laid down a good foundation that I can read it slowly in my own time to try to understand it along with the extra steps and instructions provided on how to make gui look better.

A complaint might be the more oop task. that one really sucked the life out of me.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Sorry to hear some iP increments took more time than you expected. Think of it as an investment. If you were to do the iP (or something similar) again, it is likely that A-MoreOOP will take no time at all, because you would have done it in the OOP way from the start. So, the time you invested in the iP will hopefully pay dividends in your future projects. 

Yes, GUI programming (and JavaFX) is not easy, but also is not a core SE topic. So, we can't dedicate a lot of time on it, or expect everyone to learn it in depth (some students prefer to focus on back-end code). If you are pressed for time, you might have to skim it during the iP (e.g., just copy the given code) and come back to it later if you are still interested to learn in better (e.g., if your tP feature is GUI-intensive). </markdown>

<markdown>Some of the IP increments required much more work compared to the rest, especially More-OOP required massive amounts of refactoring. Not sure if my method of refactoring were the best but only after everything had been refactored, could i test and make sure its working (could not refactor incrementally). Maybe the course could have taught proper refactoring methods earlier.

Overall, weekly requirements for IP are reasonable and manageable. 'Deadlines' for weekly requirements are lenient which gives students flexibility when they can't keep up</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Thanks for raising this issue about A-MoreOOP. The effort required for it is influenced by two factors:<br>

(a) The level of OOP applied already -- given OOP is covered in CS2030/S, we expect the code to be somewhat OOP already. The less OOP it is to begin with, the more effort A-MoreOOP will take.<br>

(b) The approach taken when doing the increment -- an incremental approach should result in a much lower effort compared to a full-scale rewrite.



In your case, it is possible either (b) alone, a combination of both (a) and (b), resulted in a higher workload. 



i) The week 2->3 briefing has a segment on the value of proceeding in small steps (at 46.50 mark), that advises to 'always keep the mashmallow on top'. However, I did not make a spefic reference from that segment to the A-MoreOOP increment due in that week. In future semesters, I should do that.

II) Also, given some students don't watch the briefings, we might have to also mention about this in the A-MoreOOP increment description. 

iii) Finally, it might be useful to remind students to apply OOP along the way, instead of assuming they will anyhow.



So thanks again for raising this, as your comment will result in a few tweaks to the course in future semesters.</markdown>

Although it also encourages me to google for more details and stuff.

Although not a core SE topic, we cover Java FX from this angle (i.e., go from plain old Java first, and introduce FXML later) to show how things work from gound up, and how FXML is simply a convenient syntax added on top, for controlling plain Java code. This is because in future we hope you go on to _build_ tools like JavaFX yourselves, and not merely stop at _using_ tools like JavaFX.</markdown>

<markdown>I appreciate the extensive work that has gone into maintaining the github pages and keep things organised for us, but a minor feedback is that the lecture recordings should be put there too, so everything is centralised. The feedback emails are useful as well, because I would have otherwise missed some errors since I don't frequently monitor the participation dashboard. 

The structure of the tutorial makes it the most dystopian tutorial I've experienced in four semesters. Telling people to switch to "Audio mode" makes it feel like we are bots, and having us face our own laptops more than people while in person is ironic. There is no actual discussion, or joy in learning. If this were a math course and all that matters is the answer and solution to get there, I can understand. But in a course that's supposed to teach us software engineering, I'm deeply disappointed in this structure.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>It's a fair point about having everything centralised in the course website. Given the course website is public access, we need to restrict some resources to students enrolled in this course only. Quizzes are one of those things, and weekly briefings also, because they contain references to quiz questions.

Noted your concerns about the tutorial format. You sound like somone who actively take part in tutorials and enjoys doing so. And yes, this format does take away some of that satisfaction away from such students, in an attempt to push students who normally NPC tutorials into engaging more with the tutorial tasks. And yes, our 'engage more with content' comes at a price of 'engage less with each other'. Given the team project we have, we hope you get other chances to engage with each other, especially if you are also taking in CS2101.

<markdown>Would like course to be more about useful stuff like Git and less about reading diagrams</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Git is definitely useful, and is used a LOT in daily SE work. This also means you will inevitably learn it within a few months of an SE internship/job, even if you don't spend a lot of university time to learn it.

There are times when knowing UML can give you an edge but it is not used a lot in the industry on a day-to-day basis, which means you will have less chance of learning it on-the-job. Hence, the need to learn it well now itself so that it takes root among your skills now itself. </markdown>

<markdown>I think the iP increments can be lessen for each week, as it may be too overwhelming for some, especially during the Chinese New Year period on week 3. Other than that, this course has been really enjoyable and I see the usefullness of the things that we are learning which can be applied for our future carreer.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Good to hear you are enjoying the course so far.

Yeah, it is unfortunate a peak in workload coincided with CNY, but we don't have  much leeway in changing the schedule based on holidays, as the timing of holidays vary from semester to semester. For example, we can't push back everything by one week to make room for CNY break because that will cause the practical exam to spill over to the reading week. </markdown>

<markdown>I'd select 10 units for the workload but it's not an option. I've been tracking the time I've spent on every mod in uni since y2s2 (I'm y4s2 now) and most typical 4 MC mods fall within the 70 to 100 hrs mark by the end of the semester, with light mods falling in 50 to 80 hrs. Currently I have logged 87h40m nearing the end of week 5 already for CS2103T. For context, some of my other most intense mods recorded include

* CS2109S (22/23s2) - 165h (I've heard they've nerfed it quite a bit since)

* LAJ2201 (23/24s1) - 145h

* LAJ1201 (22/23s2) - 130h

* CS4234 (23/24s1) - 125h

* CS2107 (22/23s2) - 100h

* CS3231 (24/25s1) - 95h

* *LAJ2202 (23/24s2) - 55h before dropping with W at the end of week 5

so CS2103T is on pace to exceed all my other mods so far.

I'm managing the workload fine now though since I have very little workload in my other mods right now and got a bit of a lead in the iP during CNY, though that lead is almost completely gone now.

The workload is really intense to me and I don't know how others that I ask seem to manage while spending less than half the time I do on the iP . The only optional task I really went out of my way to do was `A-CI`, so it's not that I'm trying to do extra work... 

Maybe I'm approaching SWE the wrong way somehow, or I'm really just not cut out for SWE. I've always been really slow with implementation and struggled a lot back in my 2030s labs a lot. I remember spending 4 hrs on a single function in the InfiniteList lab last time. I don't know how to "get" SWE, I can't get it to click properly.

I do think that the course website is decently well designed aside from being very bloated. I don't see anything wrong with the assignments either aside from the sheer amount and the quizzes possibly being annoying. Unlike with 2030s, working on the iP isn't painful per se, sometimes it feels enjoyable. But it feels really draining thinking about iP almost nonstop in the back of my head and constantly working on it for a month on top of other things.

I'm not really sure where I was going with this I ended up just spilling my train of thought into this textbox</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Sorry to hear the workload feels too high for you. Also, I assume you see (based on the stats given above -- See [my comment on 'The workload'](#Q14)) 10 units is very far from the norm. So, there is something affecting your workload specficially. 

You said you feel like it takes you too long to do SE tasks. Now, taking long is costly in terms of time (glad to hear you can still manage because of lighter loads in other courses) but not necessarily bad, if it is helping you to have a better foundation that will make you a better SWE in future. I don't know the exact cause, but from a handful of similar cases I have seen, a possible cause is looking for one perfect outcome and trying to get their in one shot. The remedy is to learn the art of moving in small incremental steps. I assume you watched the week 2->3 briefing but do take another look at the segment on 'always keeping the marshmallow on top' (at 46.50 mark). Another thing you can do is to  just observe another friend who seem to do SE stuff faster. SE is a craft that is often best learned through observation, espeicially the practical side of it. Buy that friend coffee and get him/her to do a pair programming session with you, in which he/she explain the thought process while coding, so that you can follow along and compare to your own coding practices.</markdown>

<box type="info" header="++My general responses for points raised multiple times++"
 icon=":fas-comment:" icon-size="2x" light >

Given below are some general responses to points you guys (and past students) raised multiple times:

* **The course pace is too slow in the first two weeks**: The pace is indeed slow in the first two weeks.
  Yes, about 80-90% of the students can easily deal with a faster pace in the first two weeks. 
  We have considered moving more stuff into the first two weeks but so far hesitated because
  we know (based on hard data -- we monitor student progress through course tasks on a daily basis)
  that at least 10-20% are 'slow starters' that take about 2-3 weeks to come up to speed.
  The reasons for this slow start can vary, such as not doing well in previous programming courses, not starting on the course
  till the first lecture date (which happens to be Friday), the place in the course not confirmed yet,
  travel/accommodation issues etc. Regardless of the reason, and in spite that this is only 10-20%,
  we hesitate to leave them behind at the very start, as that can make it harder for them to catch up.
  So instead, we allow you to stay one week ahead of the schedule so that those who really want to make faster
  progress can do so.
  <br>
  **The course load is too high around week 3-4**: It is true that some increments in week 3 and 4 causes a peak
  of workload during that period. However, increments causing that (e.g., A-Gradle, Level-10) need to be done
  around that time because they are prerequisites for later increments. Also, any peak in workload is better to
  appear around that period i.e., not too early in the semester but not close to the final submission so that
  there is plenty of time for you to catch up should you fall behind during that period.
  Setting a slightly higher bar around that period can cause some students to fall behind a bit,
  which hopefully pushes them to work harder to catch up while there is still enough time to catch up
  i.e., it is better to fall behind early rather than later.<br>
  Finally, unexpected spikes in workload is not uncommon in SE projects. It is good to practice how to 
  deal with them.
* **Can give more feedback on if what we are doing is correct/wrong?**: Indeed, lack of such instructor feedback
  can make the learning 'less efficient' (i.e., it takes longer).
  As you can imagine, it is challenging to provide frequent high-quality
   instructor feedback for a class of this size, teaching a subjective domain such as SE.<br>
   As the same time, giving less of such feedback goes well with ==our aim to develop your
   <tooltip content="i.e., the ability to make decisions about the quality of one's own work
   and that of others">_evaluative judgement_ skills</tooltip>==, as this is a value skills for software engineers,
   especially in an era of AI-assisted coding.<br>
   We hope that dashboards, automated feedbacks, forum discussions, iterative approach etc. we have provided
   will further help you deal with lack of such feedback directly from instructors.<br>
   To give a concrete example, here's how we apply this to one concrete learning outcome:
   * #g#**Learning Outcome (LO)**##: _can follow the Git convention for commit messages_<br> 
     #g#**Target LO Level**##: _follows the Git convention as a habit, and is able to self-evaluate/monitor_
   * #g#**Assessment**## (i.e., how to determine if the LO is achieved): This is assessed at the end of the tP.
     Specifically, marks are deducted (individually) if there are more than 1-2 violations in tP commits; 
     those who receive full marks for this component are considered as achieving the LO.<br>
     To verify the target LO Level is achieved (i.e., able to self evaluate/monitor), 
     no feedback about Git convention compliance is given during the tP,
     except for one early warning.
   * #g#**Strategy**## (i.e. steps are taken to help students achieve this LO, at the target level): 
     During the iP period, we do the following, to take you towards the target LO level:
     1. First, specify the Git standard and ask students to follow.<br>
        Also, remind about it via a tutorial question.
     1. After a while, indicate if the student is following it correctly via the dashboard
        (i.e., `GitStandard` is red/green)
     1. At some point, specify what rules are violated
        (done during code quality feedback posted in iP issue tracker;  will be done one more time after the iP is over)
     1. At the end of iP, insist on correct format for the last five commits -- a student cannot earn 
        full marks for the iP unless this requirement is met (affected students notified already).
* **Why not have traditional lectures/tutorials?**:
  Yes, we do realize _some_ students prefer our lectures to cover content (the way traditional lectures do). 
  But based on our past surveys, the majority prefers to consume the course content at their own pace.<br>
  Unlike most foundation CS courses (e.g., CS2109S, CS2100, CS2105, ...) in which almost all students start the course
  with similar level of knowledge of the topics, students in this course have very different levels of prior
  knowledge (and interest) on any SE topic we cover. So, it is hard to design such lectures that fit everyone.
  Hence, we now use blended mode delivery that allows you to regulate your own consumption of the contents.<br>
  Also, self-learning how to use tools such as Git, GitHub, Gradle, JUnit etc., 
  from given resources is good practice for future, as such tools are emerge and evolve rapidly.
